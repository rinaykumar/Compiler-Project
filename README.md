# Debugger
The debugger runs the compiler, and has a built in interpreter that runs the bytecode.

To run the Debugger: `java -jar Debugger.jar`

## Lab todos
Modify simple.x to make 3 non 0 ints, and print the result.
Add a new file with the bytcode output and save it as simple.bytecode in this repo.
